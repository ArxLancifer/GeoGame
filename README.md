# GeoGame


### Simple game buildin Javascript,HTML,CSS and Restcountries API.


In this game you will be given a random country that you must find borders (neightbour countries) that generated in main game board.
if the country is an island and have not borders you will be given random countries as unswer but all of them are wrong. Then the BAIT button comes, if you press it and there are no borders youll get rewarded with +10points, if not then you lose -20. Lastly there is a highscore section on top middle the when you press safe it will quit you from game and save your score to localStorage if its you higher score.


>PS *There are some bugs for sure that i am trying to figure out. Any advice and ideas are welcome*


Every corrent country you find its +1 point and every incorrect -1. This might change in future as long as its the first version of my project.
